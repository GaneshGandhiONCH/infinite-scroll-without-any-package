## Live App running in Netlify

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run the project locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Special notes to see the infinite scroll

Given the max the API is returning 20 elements, so to see the effect of inifinite scrolling (i.e. next API call to render the next set of the list) - here we have to keep the browser height really small at around 200px
